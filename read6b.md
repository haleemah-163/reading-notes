##  I'll tell you my freind that after i knew many informations about website developing and ubinto app or lets say they are just the basics of the basics but I became a very curious about how do computers really work
## so all computers old and modern should perform four main common differnt tasks :
### - taking input
### - storing informayion
### - processing
### - Output
## and each of these things is done by different part of the computer

## we can represent any number we want by using binary number system, and another types of data like images, sounds and texts can also be represented by numbers 
## so if you want to understand how computers work, it all comes down these simple zeros and ones and the electrical signals in the circuits behind them.
## the binary commands are stored in a memory and the cpu fetches and excutes them in sequence one after the other so binary codes control all commands on computer.
### and i have learned that the smaller circuit is the less distance the electrical signal has to go which is why modern circuits can perform buillions of calculations per second.
