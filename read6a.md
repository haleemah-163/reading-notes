###  If you want to be a web developer, you need to use the three languages and fit them together, 
### each one has a separate layer with a different purpose :
- html
- css
- java script 
### JavaScript files are text files but they have the .js extension and you need these files to save your 
### script tag code better than saving inside the html code. and you can relate it to the html file by 
### using script source tag and the best place to put it is at the end of the body.
### JavaScript has many instructions such as 
 * comments
 * declaring variables
 * statements
## when using var command you have to be aware of the rules which are:
#### var name can start with any charachter except of numbers
#### dash and period cannot be contained in the variable name 
#### You cannot use keywords or reserved words. 
#### All variables are case sensitive
#### Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
#### If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

### there are three data types used in javascript : numericals or numbers, boolean and strings.
