# INTRO and SCRIPTS 
## I learned in this part that it is not necessery to have technical or let's say software skills background to lesrn programming, it's just you have to know that java script involves :
- understanding basic programming concepts 
- learning the language itself 
- becoming familiar with how it is applied 
## And the only equipment you need  are a computer with a modern web browser installed, and your favorite code editor 
## Also there are 3 concepts before learning programming :
- what is a script
- how do computers fit with them arround the world
- how do we write a script
## So A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, like manuals or handbooks.

# EXORESSIONS and OPEERATIONS 
## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:
- expressions tha assign to a variable
- expressions that uses 2 or more valuse to return a single value

# FUNCTIONS
## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
## so to create a function you have to know such concepts:
- declaring a function
- calling a function 
- declaring functions that need information
- calling functions that need information
- getting a single value out of a function
