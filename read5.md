## chapter 10 introducing CSS
#### CSS allows you to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them. It is like an invisible box around every HTML element. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. The external CSS <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:
* href
* type 
* rel
#### There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.


## chapter 11 color 
#### You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
* RGB values
* HEX codes
* color names
* HSLA 
#### To find the color you want, you can use a color picker which is available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. 
#### When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible. To check contrast there is a handy online tool at:
[colorcontrast](www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html)

#### CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values, and sometimes you cand add Alpha which represents transparency.
##### note that brightness only adds black, whereas lightness offers both white and black.
#### so Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
