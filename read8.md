## Comparison and logical oparators 
#### comparison operators usually give one value true or false while logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

#### you can decide or evalute situations by using comparators such as:
* == and === is prefered
* != and !== is prefered
* (>)
* (>=)
* <
* <=
### and logical operators:
* && logical AND : operates true if all values are true
* || logical OR : operates true if any of the values is true
* ! logcal not : takes a single value and converts it


## FOR and HWILE loops 
### loops cheak the condition if its true then the code block will run utils the condition returns to false then it will get out of the block and continue the remaining code. and there are two main loops; for and while loops
